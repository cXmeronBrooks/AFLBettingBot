A starter project which I made to get familiar with machine learning, this is my first ever ML project
A basic logistic model which takes in hometeam and awayteam and returns a 1 if the model thinks the home team will win, or a 0 if the model thinks the away team will win.
each team has a code 1-18 which is in the "teams" dict.
Only has data since 2020
